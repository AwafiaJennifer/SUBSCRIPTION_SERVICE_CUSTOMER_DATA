# Introduction

This section provides an analysis of customer data from a subscription service, aimed at understanding customer behavior, demographics, and purchasing patterns. Using SQL, Excel, and Power BI.

## Data Sources
It segments customers based on key metrics and identifies high-value subscribers.

## Objectives

- Understand subscriber demographics and purchasing behavior.
- Identify high-value subscribers and frequent purchasers.
- Segment subscribers based on buying patterns and preferences.

- **Subscriber Profiles**: Contains data on subscriber demographics such as location and subscription amount.
- **Subscription Transaction History**: A record of each subscriber’s purchases, including product details, transaction dates, and purchase amounts.

## Analysis Process

### Excel

1. **Data Cleaning**: 
   - Missing values and duplicates were handled in Excel.

   - Revenue
   - Average subscription type revenue
   - Total revenue by region
   - Grand total revenue
   - Total number of region
   - Total revenue per months

3. **Pivot Tables**: Created pivot tables for insights into sales by subscription type, region, and month.

### SQL

**Data Aggregation**:
- SQL was used to aggregate subscriber data and calculate metrics like total purchase amount, average transaction value, and purchase frequency.

**Segmentation**:
- Subscribers were segmented based on frequency, recency, and monetary value using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.

**Querying**:
- Example queries include:

   ```sql
   -- Total number of customers from each region
   SELECT 
       region,
       COUNT("customerID") AS total_customers
   FROM 
       customer_data 
   GROUP BY 
       region
   ORDER BY 
       total_customers DESC;

   -- Most popular subscription type by number of customers
   SELECT 
       "subscriptionType",
       COUNT("customerID") AS customer_count
   FROM 
       customer_data
   GROUP BY 
       "subscriptionType"
   ORDER BY 
       customer_count DESC
   LIMIT 1;

   -- Customers who cancelled their subscription within 6 months
   SELECT 
       "customerID",
       "customer_name",
       "region",
       "subscriptionType",
       "subscriptionStart",
       "subscriptionEnds"
   FROM 
       customer_data
   WHERE 
       cancelled = 'TRUE'
       AND "subscriptionEnds" <= "subscriptionStart" + INTERVAL '6 months';

   -- Calculate average subscription duration for all customers
   SELECT 
       AVG(
           "subscriptionEnds" - "subscriptionStart"
       ) AS avg_subscription_duration_days
   FROM 
       customer_data;

   -- Customers with subscription longer than 12 months	
   SELECT 
       "customerID",
       "customer_name",
       "region",
       "subscriptionType"
   FROM 
       customer_data
   WHERE 
       AGE("subscriptionEnds", "subscriptionStart") > INTERVAL '12 months'
   ORDER BY 
       "customer_name" ASC
   LIMIT 1;

   -- Total revenue by subscription type
   SELECT 
       "subscriptionType",
       SUM("revenue") AS total_revenue
   FROM 
       customer_data 
   GROUP BY 
       "subscriptionType"
   ORDER BY 
       total_revenue DESC;

   -- Top 3 regions by subscription cancellations
   SELECT 
       region,
       COUNT("customerID") AS cancellations
   FROM 
       customer_data
   WHERE 
       cancelled = 'TRUE'
   GROUP BY 
       region
   ORDER BY 
       cancellations DESC
   LIMIT 3;

   -- Total number of active and cancelled subscriptions
   SELECT 
       COUNT(
           CASE WHEN cancelled = 'FALSE' THEN 1 END
       ) AS active_subscriptions,
       COUNT(
           CASE WHEN cancelled = 'TRUE' THEN 1 END
       ) AS cancelled_subscriptions
   FROM 
       customer_data;



Power BI was used to create a series of interactive dashboards, providing visual insights into customer and subscription data:

- **Subscriber Demographics**: Visualized demographic information of subscribers, including regional distributions, enabling a clearer understanding of the customer base.

- **Subscription Purchase Behavior**: Analyzed subscription purchases over time, showcasing trends in popular subscription types and purchase frequency.

- **Sales Trends for the Year**: Illustrated monthly and quarterly sales trends, identifying peak periods and seasonal fluctuations to help with sales forecasting.

- **Regional Purchasing Trends**: Displayed data on purchasing behaviors by region, revealing high-revenue areas and growth opportunities.
